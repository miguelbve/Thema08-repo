	abstract = {Local protein synthesis is important for neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. Thousands of mRNAs are found in axons and dendrites, and it is believed that regulating their dynamic transport and distribution is a key determinant of where and when proteins are made. In this work we quantitatively assessed the dynamic transport of three synaptically localized mRNAs in live cultured neurons without exogenous stimulation and following induction of two distinct forms of synaptic plasticity. Coupling observations of mRNA dynamics with live imaging of endogenous protein synthesis dynamics, we found that alterations in mRNA movements occur independently of their translational state, indicating a multistep mechanism of capture and decoding of an mRNA to determine when translation occurs.Decades of work have demonstrated that messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are localized and translated within neuronal dendrites and axons to provide proteins for remodeling and maintaining growth cones or synapses. It remains unknown, however, whether specific forms of plasticity differentially regulate the dynamics and translation of individual mRNA species. To address this, we targeted three individual synaptically localized mRNAs, CamkIIa, Î²-actin, Psd95, and used molecular beacons to track endogenous mRNA movements. We used reporters and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to track mRNA translation in cultured neurons. We found alterations in mRNA dynamic properties occurred during two forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (cLTP) and depression (mGluR-LTD). Changes in mRNA dynamics following either form of plasticity resulted in an enrichment of mRNA in the vicinity of dendritic spines. Both the reporters and tagging of endogenous proteins revealed the transcript-specific stimulation of protein synthesis following cLTP or mGluR-LTD. As such, the plasticity-induced enrichment of mRNA near synapses could be uncoupled from its translational status. The enrichment of mRNA in the proximity of spines allows for localized signaling pathways to decode plasticity milieus and stimulate a specific translational profile, resulting in a customized remodeling of the synaptic proteome.Analysis scripts are deposited on GitHub (https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mpibrcpo/beacon-tracker). Plasmids will be made available through Addgene. All other data, including sequences used for the molecular beacons, are available in the article and SI Appendix.},
